# Hyperclaim

**Welcome to Hyperclaim: a decentralised digital identity and credentialing solution.**

## What is Hyperclaim

As a platform for regulated interactions identity plays a fundamental role in the Hypersurface protocol. Identity is crucial in allowing (1) users to engage with one another online with confidence, (2) creating binding legal agreements between parties and (3) enabling smart contracts to validate credentials, thereby automating the process of compliance.

Verifiable digital identities create a powerful resource that enables users to engage broadly across investment, ownership, and governance on the blockchain. Identities are persistent, meaning they may only need to be verified once to open an entire network of opportunities. In this sense, an identity account can be thought of as a digital ID card. Not only is it valid across opportunities but with further standardisation, it may be used across the blockchain ecosystem.

Blockchain-based identity accounts enable information to be verified near-instantly by smart contracts. This has significant implications for issuers as it enables the process of compliance and transfer controls to be automated and enforced at the protocol level. With trust secured by a tamper-proof digital environment, compliant parties can participate with greatly reduced friction.

There have been a variety of notable attempts over the years to create digital accounts, all of which have fallen short in one way or another. Ideally, accounts would be secure, self-sovereign, identity-driven and more broadly compatible with the blockchain ecosystem—all while maintaining the simplicity to onboard first-time users.

## Claims

An identity account has no value in and of itself. To build a meaningful picture of the underlying user or organisation, an account needs “claims”. Claims can be summarised as cryptographically signed digital statements, attesting that an account has some property or properties. Claims can either be self-attested, signed by other users or signed by a trusted third-party credentialing solution. As claims are associated with an account an actionable model of identity begins to emerge. Claims create a powerful resource that enables users to engage broadly across investment, ownership, and governance on the blockchain.

Users may sign claims attesting to statements about themselves or other accounts on-chain. As claim signatures can be linked to the account in question this allows users to verify information about an account without having to store it on-chain or cede it with an intermediary. Such digital identities are persistent, meaning they may only need to be verified once to open an entire network of opportunities. In this sense, an identity account can be thought of as something like a digital ID card. Not only is identity valid across opportunities but with further standardisation, it may be used broadly across the blockchain ecosystem.

With trust secured by a tamper-proof digital ledger, compliant parties can participate with greatly reduced friction. Claims enable information to be verified near-instantly, allowing smart contracts to validate the identities of users on-chain. This has significant implications for issuers as it enables transfer controls and compliance to be automated and enforced at the protocol level.

### Claim Verification

We expect claims to play an important part in the Hypersurface ecosystem, taking on a more diverse role as the Hypersurface ecosystem grows. However, initially, claims will be used as a means of verifying statements in credential-related interactions. An example of the verification process for a credential-based interaction is:

1. AcmeKYC creates a Hypersurface account.
2. Hypersurface verifies AcmeKYC as a trusted verifier for KYC and CDD.
3. To participate in one of any number of investment opportunities a prospective investor may need to verify that they are:
a. Identity verified.
b. An accredited investor.
c. A citizen of a given jurisdiction.
4. The prospective investor pays AcmeKYC and begins the KYC process.
5. After a successful KYC process, AcmeKYC signs the appropriate claims for the prospective investor's identity account.
6. When a share transfer is attempted to the prospective investor the compliance smart contract verifies the receiver's claims and approves the transfer.

Beyond whitelisting, claims serve to add trust to interactions, allowing issuers to permit transfers automatically. Whereas previously issuers would have required complete control and would manually verify who becomes a shareholder, claims allow issuers to specify terms that shareholders must meet before they are eligible to receive shares. This enables issuers to automate transfers, which we believe will enable greatly enhanced transferability and liquidity.

## Verifiers

Hypersurface aims to establish a global, integrated, and compliant ecosystem for tokenised assets, starting with tokenised equity. However, with the vast scope and subtleties of regulation across jurisdictions to preserve its status as an infrastructure platform and to provide a solution that is truly decentralised, the Hypersurface protocol will provide a platform for an ecosystem of “verifiers”. Verifiers serve as trusted third parties that provide credentialing solutions for the Hypersurface community.

Rather than introducing itself as a bottleneck, Hypersurface will provide a broad platform and marketplace for organisations to verify statements in a formal capacity. In exchange for economic incentives that may be paid in fiat currency, protocol tokens or other crypto assets, verifiers issue claim signatures attesting to the accuracy of a given piece of information about identity. Anyone who knows that a trusted verifier has checked and signed a claim can be confident in the accuracy of a claim without needing to verify it themselves.
