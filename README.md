# Hyperclaim

**Welcome to Hyperclaim: a decentralised digital identity and credentialing solution.**

Verifiable digital identities create a powerful resource that enables users to engage broadly across investment, ownership, and governance in the Hypersurface protocol. Identities are persistent, meaning they may only need to be verified once to open an entire network of opportunities. In this sense, an identity account can be thought of as a digital ID card. Not only is it valid across opportunities but with further standardisation, it may be used across the blockchain ecosystem.
